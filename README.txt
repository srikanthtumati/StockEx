When first loading the application, the user is presented with a menu on the top, and some graphs for a demo ticker (AAPL).

At this point, the user can search for stocks (in the menu) and this will provide a detailed history about any specific ticker.

Additionally, the user can buy/sell stocks and this is done through the menu as well by clicking on the "Stocks" button. 

The user can see all transactions they have performed by clicking on "Transaction History" and a pop-up will appear that shows all orders.

The user can also visually see a stock's performance by clicking on "Graph" and will be able to see data about the stock (in two graphs) with the user choosing how far back the application should go.

Furthermore, the user is able to see a "quick-view" as the sidebar of the application that shows the time/day the user performed an action as well as the ticker involved.

Lastly, the user is able to see their current portfolio by simply clicking on "Portfolio".
